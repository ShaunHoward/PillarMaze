/**
 * A maze is a grid of pillar nodes that may be linked by planks.
 * The maze is constructed by incrementally adding nodes to specific
 * x,y coordinates which are not already occupied and linking them by
 * putting a node as a key into another nodes map of neighbors and setting
 * its value to true, otherwise the value should be false and these nodes
 * are simply unconnected neighbors. The end node, the exit of the maze,
 * will be signified by a Boolean 'end' which should be set to true, otherwise,
 * the node is a step to the end and so this value is false.
 * The other values of the nodes should initially be set to 0 or null.
